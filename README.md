# Repository focuses on recommender systems in python. 

Main project labeled as imageSimilarity is in relation to current thesis implementation. The recommender system was able to take in a given user screenshot of a application and have
the code return recommended images based on that given screenshot. 

Data taken from : https://interactionmining.org/rico

results in Recommender systems final project pdf

# A2
## Download movielens data 
 https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
 
 either ml-25m // recommended!
 or
 ml-20m 
 if you need to run the ml-20m then code needs to be modified in A2.ipynb and inputTraining.py

## execution of files: 

## RUN notebook : 
    A2  
    * this leads to an initial set up of our training and testing data as well as sets up csv's for later visualization

## EXECUTE: 
    execute.ps1 
    * this runs all algorithm alterations of our inputTraining.py and adds visualization data to our csv's

## RUN notebook: 
    Rec-Visualization 
    * this will display all several algorithms rmse and ndcg comparisions in the form of bar charts
    * When done push Rec-Visualization notebook along with a PDF copy
